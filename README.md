## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to familiarize myself with MERN stack. As this was my first web development project, I wanted to create something quite large and comprehensive to truly push myself to learn as much as possible. The tech stack encompasses a lot and throwing myself into the deep end is the way I learn best, so I decided to plunge right in.

## Tech Stack
ReactJS 
Redux 
MaterialUI 
MongoDB 
ExpressJS 
NodeJS 
Joi 
Redis 
Socket-IO 
JSONWebToken 
Gridfs 
Multer
